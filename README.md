This is the frontend for my bank web app . It was built to handle the user interface and connect to the backend banking API.

The web app allows users to sign up and log in, then interact with their account once authenticated. After login, requests 

are sent to the backend with a token so protected actions like viewing balances and transactions work properly.

The frontend fetches data from the backend and displays things like account balance and transaction history in

a simple, clean layout. Navigation between the  pages is handled on the client side to keep the experience smooth.

This frontend works together with the Spring Boot backend to form the complete bank application.
